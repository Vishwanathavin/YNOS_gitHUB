Earlier: treatment -> Consolidation -> adding params -> Generate vector -> Algorithm

Now: treatment -> consolidation -> add params ( only city coords) -> validate the datatype -> Push to database -> generate vector - >Algorithm


Focus needed: 
Treatment ( Adding new params)
consolidation (MMergin new params into a list)
Check the city type ( Till this point, it is one time operation)

validation function at application level ( This is a continuous operation) We need to pass every value through this ( We need to convert the types and print them to see if they are ok) : Check deal date, lat lon etc

Database validation function (make sure the datatype in the schema is also right)

Indexing maybe?


Ask arun: 

How to have a continuos updating concept: 
How do we have the reporting of missing values ( from database or before we push to database)
how will algortithm work? Where will it be connected
should we include all the data at once into the database
How will the algorithm pick value from database ( should we generate and keep the params as new colums)
Indexin? next?
where will the new guys data sit

Bugs:

Deal date
Lat lon :how to merget them into city
